This is a processing sketch for controlling the Maplin moving message display, they no longer sell the red only (N01GA / ) one which I bought however the colour (N00GA) one looks to be the same but with additional commands for colour control. I am unsure if this will work like for like with the colour display so please if you have one and test it let me know so I can post it here.

The project used a combination of the published PDF specification in (attached in the repo in case Maplin stop selling the colour one too) and a free serial monitoring program to decipher the commands sent by the supplied software.

At the time of writing this read me I have not checked to see if there is an update to this library and the code is not abstracted to control the display, if anyone is interested in taking this on and making it work the code basically works and
